This project was completed as part of my internship and focuses on building a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on key features like age, class, gender, and more.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🧠 Supervised machine learning classification problem
- 📊 Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
- 📈 Used algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests
- 📁 Based on the popular [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction

2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook

Open titanic_model.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells step-by-step.

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Includes information such as:

Passenger class

Sex

Age

SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard)

Parch (parents/children aboard)

Fare, Embarked, etc.



✅ Features

Data cleaning and missing value imputation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature encoding and selection

Model training and evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Final survival prediction for test data


📌 Results

Achieved accuracy of 80% on validation/test data

Identified key features contributing to survival such as Sex, Pclass, and Age
